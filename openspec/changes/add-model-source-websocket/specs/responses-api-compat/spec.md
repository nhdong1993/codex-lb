## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Source-owned models are not served over the WebSocket transport

**Reason**: Replaced by the capability-based routing, payload precedence, identity and fail-closed lookup requirements in `model-source-websocket`. The previous unconditional prohibition and lookup-failure fallback to subscription selection conflict with native source forwarding.

**Migration**: Existing sources keep capability false, HTTP forwarding and the `model_source_requires_http_transport` error. Opted-in sources use native Responses WebSocket. Raw/enforced alias checks still run on initial and subsequent creates; subscription anchors, uploaded files, structural compaction exclusions and restricted-capability routing retain precedence. A source/backend switch on an existing connection requires reconnect. Source lookup failures now fail before reservation instead of silently selecting a subscription account.


## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Previous-response source routing follows proven ownership

When a Responses request targets a configured Responses-compatible model source and carries `previous_response_id`, the proxy MUST use recorded subscription-account ownership as the veto for model-source routing. The proxy MUST NOT infer ownership from the response identifier's syntax. A recorded subscription owner MUST keep the request on subscription routing. When no subscription owner is recorded, the configured model source MUST remain authoritative, including when the identifier uses the canonical OpenAI `resp_` hexadecimal shape.

For the direct Responses WebSocket transport, a recorded subscription owner MUST keep the request on the owner-bound subscription path. A configured source model without a recorded subscription owner SHALL use the native source WebSocket path only when the source and model are eligible under `model-source-websocket`; otherwise it MUST retain `model_source_requires_http_transport`.

#### Scenario: Recorded subscription owner overrides an HTTP model source

- **GIVEN** a Responses-compatible source is configured for the requested model
- **AND** request logs record a subscription account as the owner of `previous_response_id`
- **WHEN** the client calls `/backend-api/codex/responses` or `/v1/responses`
- **THEN** the request is not forwarded to the model source
- **AND** subscription routing preserves the recorded account owner

#### Scenario: Canonical source response ID remains source-routed over HTTP

- **GIVEN** a Responses-compatible source is configured for the requested model
- **AND** no subscription account is recorded as owner of `previous_response_id`
- **AND** `previous_response_id` uses a canonical OpenAI-compatible `resp_` hexadecimal shape
- **WHEN** the client calls `/backend-api/codex/responses` or `/v1/responses`
- **THEN** the request is forwarded to the configured model source

#### Scenario: Direct WebSocket preserves a recorded subscription owner

- **GIVEN** a source is also configured for the requested model
- **AND** request logs record a subscription account as the owner of `previous_response_id`
- **WHEN** a direct Responses WebSocket client submits the follow-up
- **THEN** the request remains on the owner-bound subscription WebSocket path
- **AND** the proxy does not emit `model_source_requires_http_transport`

#### Scenario: Direct WebSocket source continuation falls back to HTTP

- **GIVEN** a source without native WebSocket capability is configured for the requested model
- **AND** no subscription account is recorded as owner of `previous_response_id`
- **AND** `previous_response_id` uses a canonical OpenAI-compatible `resp_` hexadecimal shape
- **WHEN** a direct Responses WebSocket client submits the follow-up
- **THEN** the proxy emits `model_source_requires_http_transport`
- **AND** the request is not sent to a subscription upstream

### Requirement: A disabled model source refuses its models instead of falling through

The system SHALL NOT dispatch to a subscription account a request whose model
is served by an OpenAI-compatible model source that an operator has switched
off. It SHALL refuse such a request with HTTP status `503` and error code
`model_source_disabled`.

"Switched off" covers both a disabled source row and a disabled model row on an
enabled source. The refusal SHALL apply on `/v1/chat/completions`,
`/v1/responses`, and `/backend-api/codex/responses`.

The refusal SHALL be decided by the ordinary source-selection rules with the
enabled-state filter inverted and nothing else changed: same candidate list
(raw client alias and normalized model), same API key model allowlist, same
source assignment scope, same subscription-registry precedence, same route
shape, same streaming requirement. A request that the ordinary lookup would
have missed for any reason other than enabled state MUST keep its existing
behaviour, including a model no source exposes, a source the API key is not
assigned to, a chat-only source asked for a Responses route, and a
subscription-registry slug that an unscoped API key never source-routes.

Requests excluded from source routing — a terminal `compaction_trigger`, and
Responses requests pinned to the subscription account that received an uploaded
file — MUST NOT be refused, and MUST proceed to subscription routing as before.

The WebSocket source preflight SHALL refuse an opted-in source or model that is disabled with `model_source_disabled` before reservation. Sources without native capability SHALL retain `model_source_requires_http_transport`. An established native source session SHALL revalidate enablement before dispatching another turn. Structural subscription exclusions and recorded subscription owners SHALL retain their precedence.

The refusal MUST happen before any usage reservation is taken, so a refused
request strands no reservation, and MUST NOT create a request log entry for a
dispatch that never happened.

#### Scenario: Chat request for a disabled source's model is refused

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible model source exposes model `m` and is disabled
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/chat/completions` with model `m`
- **THEN** the response is `503` with error code `model_source_disabled`
- **AND** no subscription account is selected for the request
- **AND** no usage reservation is left held

#### Scenario: Responses request for a disabled source's model is refused

- **GIVEN** a Responses-capable OpenAI-compatible model source exposes model `m` and is disabled
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/responses` or `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` with model `m`
- **THEN** the response is `503` with error code `model_source_disabled`
- **AND** no subscription account is selected for the request

#### Scenario: A disabled model on an enabled source is refused

- **GIVEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible model source whose model row for `m` is disabled
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/chat/completions` with model `m`
- **THEN** the response is `503` with error code `model_source_disabled`

#### Scenario: A model no source exposes is unaffected

- **GIVEN** no model source exposes model `m`, enabled or disabled
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/chat/completions` with model `m`
- **THEN** subscription routing proceeds exactly as it did before this requirement

#### Scenario: A WebSocket turn for a disabled source's model bounces to HTTP

- **GIVEN** an HTTP-only Responses-capable model source exposes model `m` and is disabled
- **WHEN** a client requests model `m` over the WebSocket transport, at connect time or on a later turn over an already-open socket
- **THEN** the turn is refused with the service-level `model_source_requires_http_transport` failure
- **AND** the turn is not forwarded to a subscription account upstream

#### Scenario: A subscription slug shadowed by a disabled source is unaffected

- **GIVEN** a disabled OpenAI-compatible model source lists a slug the subscription model registry already serves
- **AND** an API key without source assignment scoping
- **WHEN** the key requests that slug
- **THEN** the request is not refused with `model_source_disabled`
- **AND** subscription routing proceeds unchanged
